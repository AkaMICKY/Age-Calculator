# 🧮 Age Calculator

A simple C# console application that asks for the user’s birth year and calculates their current age. It’s a small but practical project to practice working with DateTime and basic input/output in C#.

⚡ Installation  
Clone the repository with:  
git clone https://github.com/AkaMicky/AgeCalculator.git  
cd AgeCalculator  
Open the project in Visual Studio (or any C# IDE) and run the program.

🎯 Usage  
When prompted, enter your birth year. The program subtracts it from the current year and displays your age.  
Example:  
Enter your birth year: 2010  
You are 15 years old.

🔮 Future Improvements  
- Add TryParse to handle invalid input and prevent crashes.  
- Extend functionality to calculate how long you’ve lived not only in years, but also in months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
