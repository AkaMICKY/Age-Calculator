# 🧮 Age Calculator

A tiny, beginner-written C# console utility that tells you how old you are in whatever unit you like and gives you a playful label (“Teenager”, “Elder”, …) plus a countdown to your next birthday.

## Features
- Validates the date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and rejects future birthdays.
- Choose output unit: years, months, days, hours or seconds.
- Displays both the rounded age and a more precise decimal value.
- Prints a friendly life-stage label (Infant, Toddler, Child, Teenager, Young Adult, Middle-Age, Elder, Old-Elder).
- Counts down days & months until your next birthday.
## 📌 Usage

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter your birthday in the format `YEAR-MONTH-DAY` (e.g., `2009-08-15`).  
3. Choose the unit of measurement:  
   - 1 → Years  
   - 2 → Months  
   - 3 → Days  
   - 4 → Hours  
   - 5 → Seconds
